# this folder is deprecated

i just kept it in case i need some native ros projekt in here


however i felt that its not the best idea to build a colcon project algon with normal fastapi python code you run with uvicorn, so i could not import the services inside the same project.

somehow its required to create a separate project and build this with colcon, but thats a bit overkill here
